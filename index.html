      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am an Assistant Manager of the deli at Niagara County Produce. I am also a coffee-nut that plays a lot of video games.
      I spend my Summers around a campfire and riding my motorcycle as much as possible.
      I heavily value the simple things in life, however I strive for perfection in everything I do.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I have very good knife-skills, especially for being a home cook. I learned all of the basics about cooking when I was a line-cook at Country Pride.
        From there, it was easy for me to expand my knowledge of spices, and learn more advanced techniques.
        I like to repetitively cook specialty dishes until I am satisfied with quality and amount of time it takes to make the dish.</p>

        <p>My three best dishes are:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>A very customizable omelette</li>
          <li>Gourmet Pizza</li>
          <li>Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli (Pasta made from scratch)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Absorbing Data</h3>
        <p>My ability to thoroughly comprehend a lot of information at one time helps in numerous aspects of life.
        This helps a lot with management.  I can efficiently and accurately relay information amongst my coworkers.
        Thoroughly absorbing data makes me a very dependable person.
        It also allows me to smoothly adapt to technology advancements and new environments.</p>
